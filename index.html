                <p>
                    I am an undergraduate student studying a Bachelor of Computer Science at Dalhousie University. I have a keen interest in game development and plan to pursue it as my future career in the computer science field. A dream career would be working at a company like Electronic Arts, to make a sports game. I have always had a mindset for programming, and problem solving has been one of my strong points since a young age. I have always been a gamer so I have a sense of users interests as well. These are a few of many reasons why I believe game development is for me.
